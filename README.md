To run this application, in your Terminal type
```bash
bundle install # this installs all dependencies in the Gemfile
rails db:{drop,create,migrate} # this sets up your database by removing an existing DB, creating a new one, and sets up the structure of the tables and columns
rails s # this starts the rails server locally so you can see the application in your browser
```

Then, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser window.
